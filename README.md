   ```

## üì¶ Usage

### Example 1: Display a Puzzle in Real-Time

```python
from word_search_generator import WordSearch, Puzzle
import cv2

# Initialize the puzzle with predefined words and size
wordsearch = WordSearch(['hello', 'world'], size=15)
puzzle = Puzzle(wordsearch)

# Generate and display the puzzle using OpenCV
cv2.imshow('Word Search Puzzle', puzzle.draw())
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Example 2: Save a Puzzle as an Image

```python
from word_search_generator import WordSearch, Puzzle
import cv2

# Initialize the puzzle with predefined words and size
wordsearch = WordSearch(['hello', 'world'], size=15)
puzzle = Puzzle(wordsearch)

# Generate and save the puzzle as an image
cv2.imwrite('output/word_search_puzzle.png', puzzle.draw())
```

### Example 3: Print a Puzzle to the Console

```python
from word_search_generator import WordSearch, Puzzle

# Initialize the puzzle with predefined words and size
wordsearch = WordSearch(['hello', 'world'], size=15)
puzzle = Puzzle(wordsearch)

# Print the puzzle to the console
print(puzzle.generate())
```

## üîß Configuration (if applicable)

The program uses a set of constants for customization:

- `RESOLUTION_MULT`: Multiplier for the base resolution.
- `BOLD`: Font style for bold text.
- `WHITE`, `BLACK`: Colors used in the puzzle.

You can modify these constants to change the appearance and size of the puzzles.
